## Introduction

Linear regression is one of the most basic and widely used algorithms in machine learning. This project aims to implement it from scratch, without relying on external libraries, to deepen your understanding of the underlying mathematics and programming concepts.


## Features

- Implementation of simple linear regression.
- Training and prediction functionalities.
- Error calculation using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- Visualization of data and regression line (optional).

## Requirements

To run this project, you need:

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/your_username/ft_linear_regression.git
	cd ft_linear_regression
	```

2. Create an environment:
	```python3 -m venv .venv
	source .venv/bin/activate
	```

3. Install the requirements:
	```pip install -r requirements.txt
	```

4. Run the training script:
	```bash
	python train.py
	```

5. Use the model to make predictions:
	```bash
	python predict.py
	```

6. (Optional) Visualize the results:
	```bash
	python visualize.py
	```

## Usage for all in one

1. Clone the repository:
	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/your_username/ft_linear_regression.git
	cd ft_linear_regression
	```

2. Create an environment:
	```python3 -m venv .venv
	source .venv/bin/activate
	```

3. Install the requirements:
	```pip install -r requirements.txt
	```

4. Run the training script:
	```bash
	python main.py
	```

## Testing

To test the implementation, you can use the provided dataset or create your own. Ensure the dataset is in CSV format with two columns: one for the feature (X) and one for the target (Y).

## Credits

This project was developed by **lseiberr** as part of the 42 curriculum at 42 Perpignan.
